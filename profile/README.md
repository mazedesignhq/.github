# Our values

⚡️  Build fast
With speed comes faster learnings. We believe in continuous improvements so that our users get more value faster and we can learn rapidly.

✨  Beautiful always
We’re a design-led company and believe in the power of beautiful design to drive business growth, user satisfaction and ultimately to change the world.

🧪  Iterate everything
Everything we do at Maze is an iteration to the next step. We don’t strive for immediate perfection but rather take an experimental approach to everything we do.

📊  Informed by data
We believe in the power of data. And this is why we use data as the basis of our decision-making—but we also believe in going with your gut feeling from time to time. We’re human after all.

👶  Embrace vulnerability
We believe that improving anything starts with the ability to listen to others. Feedback — both internal and external — is vital to everything we do.

🫂  Human design
We always consider the human on the other side of every interaction: when we design experiences, develop our product, create marketing materials, or walk you through our product.
